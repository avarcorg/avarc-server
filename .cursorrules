rules:
  spring-boot-java:
    - Follow SOLID principles for object-oriented programming.
    - Use Spring Boot's built-in features for dependency management and configuration.
    - Implement RESTful services using Spring's MVC framework.
    - Use JPA/Hibernate for database interactions; prefer Criteria API over raw SQL queries.
    - Configure transactions properly and use rollback for error handling.
    - Implement logging using SLF4J or Logback.
    - Use JWT for authentication.
    - Use Spring Modulith for event-driven architecture.

  react.js:
    - Use functional components with hooks.
    - Employ state management tools such as Redux or Context API.
    - Apply TypeScript for type safety.
    - Optimize component rendering with React.memo and useCallback.
    - Implement proper error boundaries for handling UI errors.
    - Use Jest and React Testing Library for testing components.

  postgis-database:
    - Use spatial data efficiently utilizing PostGIS functions.
    - Apply proper indexing for spatial queries to optimize performance.
    - Use connection pooling for managing database connections.
    - Regularly back up spatial data to prevent data loss.

  nginx:
    - Configure NGINX as a reverse proxy for load balancing and caching.
    - Implement secure HTTP headers and SSL/TLS for security.
    - Optimize configurations for performance, including timeout and worker settings.
    - Set up logging to monitor access and error logs.

  docker:
    - Use multi-stage builds to optimize Docker images.
    - Implement health checks and diagnostics.
    - Ensure containerization of all services with proper networking configuration.
    - Use Docker Compose for development and defining multi-container applications.

  redis:
    - Use Redis for managing state persistence across multiple backend instances.
    - Implement Redis for caching and reducing load from the primary data store.
    - Use Redis Pub/Sub for message broadcasting between backend services.
    - Monitor Redis performance and perform regular maintenance.

recommendations:
  - Review dependencies regularly for updates and vulnerabilities.
  - Employ CI/CD tools for automated deployments.
  - Implement monitoring and logging across all services to maintain system health.
