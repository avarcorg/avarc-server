# Communication
  - The Frontend and the Backend identify object via UUID
  - Set the UUID in the service classes, not in the mapper

# API Request Flow
  - Browser makes request to frontend (e.g., `/api/auth/login`)
  - Frontend (Next.js) receives the request
  - Frontend makes server-side axios call to backend using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST`
  - Backend processes the request and returns response
  - Frontend forwards the response back to the browser

# Security Architecture
  - Backend is not directly accessible from the browser
  - All API calls are proxied through the frontend
  - CORS is handled server-side
  - Sensitive headers and tokens are managed server-side
  - Better control over request/response transformation
