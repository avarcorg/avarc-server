# avArc Frontend (Next.js)

- App lives in `avarc-frontend` using the App Router under `src/app`.
- Keep `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` pinned to the latest stable releases.
- Use the Maven build to run install, build, and security audit steps.

## Security
- Run `npm run audit` (or Maven `verify`) before release.
- Treat audit findings at `high` or higher as build blockers.
